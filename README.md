# CSE306-Ray-tracer

This is an individual project conducted in the 6-th semester of my bachelor, in the course CSE306 Computer Graphics. Starting from scratch with C++, a simple ray-tracer is built for rendering spheres, simulating direct and indirect lighting of diffuse materials, reflective and transparent materials, soft shadows, depth of field, and motion blur.
